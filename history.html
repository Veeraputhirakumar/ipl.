            <h2>Indian Premier League</h2>
            <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) (also known as the TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons) is a men's Twenty20 (T20) cricket league that is annually held in India and contested by ten city-based franchise teams. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) founded the league in 2007. The competition is usually held between March and May every year, and has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme; fewer international cricket tours take place during IPL seasons.

                The IPL is the most-popular cricket league in the world; in 2014, it was ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on YouTube. The brand value of the IPL in 2022 was ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion). According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the economy of India. In December 2022, the IPL became a decacorn valued at US$10.9 billion, registering a 75% growth in dollar terms since 2020 when it was valued at $6.2 billion, according to a report by consulting firm D & P Advisory.The league has banned players from Pakistan since 2008, the previous and only time they appeared in the IPL.
                
                As of 2023, there have been fifteen seasons of the tournament. The current title holders are the Gujarat Titans, who won the 2022 contest by defeating Rajasthan Royals in the final.</p>
            
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The Indian Cricket League (ICL) was founded in 2007 with funding provided by Zee Entertainment Enterprises. The ICL was not recognised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the BCCI was not pleased with its committee members joining the ICL executive board. To prevent players from joining the ICL, the BCCI increased the prize money in its domestic tournaments and imposed lifetime bans on players joining the ICL, which the BCCI considered a rebel league.</p>
            <h2>Foundation</h2>
            <p>On 13 September 2007, following India's victory at the 2007 T20 World Cup,the BCCI announced a franchise-based Twenty20 cricket (T20) competition called Indian Premier League. The first season was due to start in April 2008 in a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, who led the IPL effort, gave details of the tournament including its format, prize money, franchise revenue system and squad composition rules. It was also announced the IPL would be run by a seven-man governing council composed of former India players and BCCI officials, and that the two top IPL teams would qualify for that year's Champions League Twenty20. Modi also said the BCCI had been working on the idea for two years, and that the IPL was not started as a "knee-jerk reaction" to the ICL.[17] The league's format was similar to that of the English Premier League and the National Basketball Association in the United States.[16] According to Modi: "The IPL has been designed to entice an entire new generation of sports fans into the grounds throughout the country. The dynamic Twenty20 format has been designed to attract a young fan base, which also includes women and children."

                To choose team owners for the new league, an auction of franchises was held on 24 January 2008; the reserve prices of the franchises was around $400 million.At the end of the auction, the winning bidders and the cities in which the teams would be based: Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Mohali, and Mumbai.The franchises were sold for a total of $723.59 million.The ICL ended in 2008.
                
                Pakistani players have not been allowed to take part in the IPL following the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks due to Pakistan's involvement in the attacks, which angered many Indians</p>
            <h2>Expansions and terminations</h2>
            <p>On 21 March 2010, new franchises Pune Warriors India and Kochi Tuskers Kerala joined the league before the fourth season in 2011. Sahara Adventure Sports Group bought the Pune franchise for $370 million while Rendezvous Sports World bought the Kochi franchise for $333.3 million. On 11 November 2011, Kochi Tuskers Kerala were terminated when they failed to pay the BCCI the 10% bank guarantee element of the franchise before the 2011 season began.

                On 14 September 2012, after the 2009 champion team the Deccan Chargers could not find new owners, the BCCI announced the team would be terminated.On 25 October, an auction for the replacement franchise was held; Sun TV Network won the bid for the Hyderabad franchise.The team was named Sunrisers Hyderabad.
                
                Pune Warriors India withdrew from the IPL on 21 May 2013 over financial differences with the BCCI. The BCCI officially terminated the franchise on 26 October 2013 because the franchise failed to provide the necessary bank guarantee.
                
                On 14 June 2015, it was announced two-time champions Chennai Super Kings and the inaugural season champions Rajasthan Royals would be suspended for two seasons following their role in a spot-fixing and betting scandal. On 8 December 2015, following an auction, it was announced Pune and Rajkot would replace Chennai and Rajasthan for two seasons. The replacement teams were Rising Pune Supergiant and Gujarat Lions.
                
                Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the venue for the 2020 season was moved and games were played in the United Arab Emirates.In August 2021, the BCCI announced two new franchises, which would be based in two of the six cities shortlisted by the BCCI – Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Cuttack, Guwahati, Ranchi and Dharamshala – would join the league starting from the 2022 season. In closed bidding held on 25 October, RPSG Group and CVC Capital won bids for the teams. RPSG paid ₹7,000 crore (US$880 million) for Lucknow and CVC won Ahmedabad for ₹5,200 crore (US$650 million). The teams were subsequently named Lucknow Super Giants and Gujarat Titans.</p>
